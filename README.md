CREATE PROJECT - This is a program that contains a list of ~100 unique fruits from across the world. The user is given the option to sort the fruits by either tiny, small, medium, large or enormous. The code will then return  all of the fruits that fit within the entered parameters. 

SLOT MACHINE - This program is a game that allows the user to bet any amount of coins, given the 100 they start with. ["7","♣","♠"] These are the 3 symbols that are used for the program. If the clovers or spades line up (3 in a column), the user wins the round and gain 100 points back. If the 7 symbol lines up three times in a column, the user wins the jackpot and wins 1,000 coins. Otherwise the amount used for the bet is lost.
